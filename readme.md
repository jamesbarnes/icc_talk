# ICC Talk Artifacts

This repo contains the code samples shown in my March 9, 2016 talk at the Intellegent Content Conference.

## icc_spider

A simple [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) project that scrapes data from the Intellegent Content Conference's website. 

## icc_proto

A single web page and accompanying JavaScripts to display content from a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZ2uvRhRFd2XTq-xX71d-w3jTUYVXeQvfSWuoySOHxI/pubhtml) made from the ouput of the above spider. It uses the (awesome) [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to load the spreadsheet.
